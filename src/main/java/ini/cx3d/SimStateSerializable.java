 * Special note on Collections that contain elements where the order is irrelevant: e.g. Set of Cells
 * don't use json array notation, but object notation with the same key repeated
 * This important for the comparison if two simulation states are the same
 * e.g. two worker threads adding cell elements to an ArrayList -> position irrelevant
